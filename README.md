# Critical-Mass-Challenge
## Work/project examples
### Meta Beats
A web3 music marketplace consisting of the top songs and artist you can search, 
sample, purchase, and save using your Metamask account. 
* Created a web (and mobile friendly) application to purchase music with 
cryptocurrency (React, Firebase, Moralis).
* Used Audio DB API to extract the necessary music data and information
* Added authentication with Google, Email and Metamask
* Designed associated wireframes with Figma 
* This project was the winner of our cohort capstone competition

I was primarily responsible for the extraction and manipulation of information, such as artist,track name, album cover etc, from our API and desplay it on the top songs carousel. I created the filter functionality, as well as the artist search functionality. Although those were my primary responsibilities I had hands on experience with every functionality in this project.

## Inspiration
Ive been inspired recently by all the web3 and blockchain news and developments. The field has been growing significantly and its inspired me to start my own NFT market application with a fellow partner. 

## Focus
I will use my time at CM to grow into a well rounded developer. I want to continue to grow in the process of designing and implementing react or other freamworks to create applications that will be used on a everyday basis. I want to learn the best techniques from my peers and I hope to use this knowledge to contribute to an ongoing project. I would like to improve my knowledge in design and learn new development techniques.
